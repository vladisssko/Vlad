Hello World,

here is quick explanation of my final project called dental web app.

First of all it is business web page as any other with goal of providing basic informations about private dental clinic.
Second, I have implemented informational system that stores informations about registered users.(PYTHON,FLASK,SQL lite).
Third, I have implemented feature for patients and doctors/nurses that helps them with scheduling appointment described below.(PYTHON,FLASK,SQL,JAVASCRIPT,)

Request appointment feature.

Whenever patients are registered they are able to request appointment by clicking on "request appointment" in navbar, where they provide
informations as : message, preferred contact method, proffered day of app. and  preferred time of app.
Once they submit form, all info are stored and if patient wants to see his requests history he/she can do it by clicking on "My requests" in navbar.

Doctor/nurse side:
So the patient has requested his appointment and is waiting to be contacted.
If doctor/nurse will sign in , they will see different content then patients do.
They will see straight away  all appointment requests (in table) that have not been "handled" = (doctor/nurse will contact patient and agree together on appointment date/time.)
After clicking on any of appointment row they will get new html page with details of that specific clicked appointment, so the doctor/nurse can go ahead and handle call with patient.
Doctor/nurse then can move that specific appointment request (by hitting button) , to the another section called : Handled appointment requests. (like history)


I think this feature should make first contact more convenient for patients and dentists/nurse as dentists which are busy should not be disturbed during surgeries.
So once they would be free they would get in touch with patients with help of this feature.

Patients would gain possibility of first contact after working hours and call/email back by dentist/nurse to confirm on appointment details mentioned in request form.


Thanks, Vladimir.
